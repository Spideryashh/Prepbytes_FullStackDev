    <h1>Backtracking is Live</h1>

    <p>Copyright &copy;2002 by David Matuszek</p>

    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
    <p>
        The usual <em>scenario</em> is that you are faced with a number of options, and you
        must choose one of these.<br> After you make your choice you will get a new set
        of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made.
        This <strong>procedure</strong> is repeated over and over until you reach a final state.<br> If you
        made a good <b>sequence</b> of choices, your final state is a <i>goal state;</i> if
        you didn't, it isn't.

        Conceptually, you start<sub>go</sub> at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good
        leaves and some<sup>30</sup> bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all good or
        all bad.<br> You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root,
        you choose one of its <ins>hello</ins> children to move to, and you keep this up until you get
        to a <del>plant</del> leaf.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search
        for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the
        next option in that set of options.<br> If you run out of options, revoke the choice
        that got you here, and try another choice at that node.<br> If you end up at the
        root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.

    <ol>
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
